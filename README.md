# WSTUNLTD™ Muse Ai x Omarchy Linux Project by JJUANtheBRAND™

**Muse on Omarchy Linux, packaged so anyone can load it the same way we did.**

This repo packages the exact setup we proved on October 22, 2026: a
2011 MacBook Air running Omarchy Linux, turned into a Muse connected
machine you can talk to and drive from chat.

It has two parts. Both are included. You can install one or both.

1. **Muse AI launcher.** A menu entry named "Muse AI" in Omarchy's
   launcher. It opens muse.ai as a standalone window, with the official
   blue Muse icon, following Omarchy's own webapp pattern.
2. **Muse Gadget service.** Meta's official Muse Gadgets Linux Device
   SDK, installed the Omarchy way. Once paired, Muse can check the
   machine's health and, only at your direction, run commands and read
   or write files on that machine from your Muse chat. Programs on the
   machine can also push messages into your chats with
   `musegadget send-user-msg`.

This repo does not contain Meta's SDK code and does not contain a local
model. Muse stays in the cloud. This repo is a wrapper: it checks your
machine, downloads the official installer from Meta's official repo at
install time, and adds the Omarchy launcher, checks, and guardrails
around it.

Upstream: https://github.com/facebookincubator/muse-gadget-sdk
Upstream license: Apache 2.0. This wrapper: MIT, see LICENSE.

## Read this first: the safety rule

The gadget service grants cloud command access to the machine it runs
on, as the user who installed it, including sudo if that user has sudo.

Install it only on your own studio, demo, or personal machine.
Never install it on a machine you sell, ship, or hand to someone else
as an appliance. That is the rule this project was built under, and it
is printed again by the installer before anything runs.

## Tested hardware

First verified install, October 22, 2026:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Machine | MacBook Air 11-inch, Mid 2011 |
| CPU | Intel Core i5-2467M, x86_64 |
| RAM | 4 GB |
| Storage | 128 GB SSD, about 86 GB free after install |
| OS | Omarchy 4.0.6-1, kernel 7.2.8-9-omarchy |
| Desktop | Hyprland 0.56.2, Wayland |
| Bluetooth | Built in controller, powered on, pairable |
| T2 chip | None, so no T2 workarounds needed |
| Result | Installed, paired, health check passed, command test passed |

4 GB is enough for this project. The gadget service is a lightweight
Python service, not a local model. For local models, see the companion
project: WSTUNLTD™ Second Brain Omarchy by JJUANtheBRAND™ at

## What you need

1. Omarchy Linux installed and updated. Other Arch based systems will
   likely work, the upstream installer prints an "untested, Arch-based"
   warning on Omarchy. That warning is expected.
2. A normal user account with sudo. Do not run the installer as root.
   The upstream installer refuses root.
3. Bluetooth working, for pairing only. Check: `ls /sys/class/bluetooth`
   should list a controller, and `bluetoothctl show` should say
   Powered: yes. After pairing, the machine stays connected over the
   network. Bluetooth is not needed day to day.
4. A Muse account, and the Muse app on your phone with Developer mode
   on, then Settings, then Devices, ready for pairing.
5. An SDK token from gadgets.muse.ai, under Account, then SDK tokens.
   It starts with `mgst_`. Keep it private. Never paste it into a repo,
   an issue, or a chat. You paste it only on your own machine, at
   install time.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microhustlestack/muse-ai-omarchy.git
cd muse-ai-omarchy

# 1. Check the machine first. No changes are made.
#    (bash form, so a fresh clone works even without the exec bit set)
bash bin/muse-ai doctor

# 2. Install the Muse AI menu launcher only. No sudo, no token needed.
bash install.sh launcher

# 3. Install the gadget service. This downloads Meta's official
#    installer, shows it to you, then runs it with your token.
bash install.sh gadget
# It will prompt for your mgst_ token, hidden as you type.

# 4. Pair inside the 10 minute window, in the Muse app:
#    Developer mode on, Settings, Devices, then pair this machine.

# 5. Verify. After install.sh, muse-ai is on your PATH.
muse-ai status
muse-ai doctor
```

Then, from your Muse chat, ask Muse to check the machine. A healthy
paired machine reports its temperature, free memory, free disk, uptime,
and load, and a harmless test command returns your username, hostname,
`x86_64` or `aarch64`, and `active` for the musegadget service.

No terminal needs to stay open after install. The service runs in the
background. The machine only needs to be awake and on Wi-Fi.

## Install routes

### User install, no packaging needed

`bash install.sh` with no argument installs the launcher and the CLI
into `~/.local`, and prints the gadget step without running it.
`bash install.sh gadget` runs the gadget step. `bash install.sh all`
does launcher, CLI, and gadget in one pass.

### Arch package, AUR style

```bash
makepkg -si
```

The PKGBUILD installs the CLI to `/usr/bin/muse-ai`, the launcher to
`/usr/share/applications/`, and the docs. It does not install the
gadget service and it does not ask for a token. That step is always a
separate, deliberate run of `muse-ai install-gadget`, for the safety
reason above.

## The CLI

```text
muse-ai doctor           Check OS, arch, Bluetooth, service, launcher
muse-ai status           Short status: paired service and launcher
muse-ai launcher         Install or reinstall the Muse AI menu entry
muse-ai install-gadget   Download Meta's official installer and run it
muse-ai pair-help        Print the pairing steps in order
muse-ai uninstall        Remove the launcher and CLI user install
                         (the gadget service has its own official
                         uninstall: bash install.sh --uninstall
                         from the upstream installer)
```

## How the launcher works

Omarchy already ships a webapp pattern: a `.desktop` file whose Exec
line is `omarchy-launch-webapp https://example.com/`. This project
follows that pattern exactly:

- File: `~/.local/share/applications/Muse.desktop`
- Name: `Muse AI`
- Exec: `omarchy-launch-webapp https://muse.ai/`
- Icon: `muse-ai`, PNG renders at 256, 128, 64, 48, and 32 px, made
  at install time with `rsvg-convert` from the official Muse squiggle
  SVG at https://muse.ai/images/favicon/app-squiggle.svg, downloaded
  directly by your machine. If `rsvg-convert` is missing, the SVG
  itself is installed as the icon.

## Troubleshooting

- **Token rejected.** You pasted a placeholder, an old token, or an
  API key from somewhere else. Make a fresh SDK token at
  gadgets.muse.ai, Account, SDK tokens, and rerun. This was the only
  failure in our first attempt on the 2011 Air.
- **Ran as root.** Leave the root shell and rerun as your normal user.
- **No Bluetooth controller.** Check `systemctl status bluetooth`,
  try `bluetoothctl power on`, and check firmware. A USB Bluetooth
  dongle is the fallback on very old hardware.
- **Pairing window missed.** Rerun `muse-ai install-gadget` or restart
  the service and pair right away. You get a fresh window.
- **Icon shows black or invisible.** Clear the thumbnail cache and
  reinstall the launcher: `muse-ai launcher`. The working icon on our
  test Air is the blue render, verified on device.
- **Service not active.** `systemctl status musegadget --no-pager`
  and `journalctl -u musegadget -f` on the machine.

## What this repo is not

- Not a local Muse model. There is no model download here.
- Not a fork of Meta's SDK. The official installer is fetched from the
  official repo at install time, so you always get Meta's current code,
  from Meta.
- Not for sold or shipped machines. Studio and personal machines only.
- Not affiliated with or endorsed by Meta. Muse and Omarchy are their
  owners' projects and marks. This is a community packaging project by
  JJUANtheBRAND™ under WSTUNLTD™.

a second life on Omarchy Linux: the same 2011 Air also runs the
WSTUNLTD™ Second Brain Omarchy package end to end.
